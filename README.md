# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview
We have been tasked with predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Using Alphabet Soup Charity's dataset and our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, we created a model to make our predictions.

## Results


### Data Preprocessing
- What variables are considered your targets for your model?
- What variables are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variables are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
